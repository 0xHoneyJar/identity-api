## LANDED 2026-06-01 — cutover complete (Acts 3.L3 + 4 GREEN)

Operator GO ("you apply"). Executed with KRANZ discipline:
1. **Migrate prod (read-only status first):** prod was at 0002; applied 0003–0007 (all verified additive — no DROP/TRUNCATE/destructive ALTER; the one `DELETE` is a conditional pg_cron 90d retention job on a table the same migration creates). `migrate status` after: applied(7), pending(0). Via the public proxy (`railway run` injects the internal URL, unreachable locally).
2. **Merge `#28` → main:** squash `895a6d9`.
3. **Deploy:** the service is NOT GitHub-connected (`source: none`) — no auto-deploy on merge. Deployed via `railway up` (the established method; deployment `378d13ca` SUCCESS).
4. **Smoke (GREEN):** `POST /v1/identity/resolve` no-token → **401** (facade live + OQ-3 `.auth()` gate firing; was 404 on old code) · `GET /v1/me` → 401 · `POST /v1/auth/service-jwt` → **400 not 404** (ES256 svc-jwt route un-lagged).

**Correction (KRANZ — a claim falsified by the substrate):** I'd listed "JWKS `/.well-known/jwks.json` stops 404-ing" as a smoke check. WRONG — JWKS is not a registered route in `src/api/index.ts` (only a docblock in `src/jwt-mint.ts`), so it still 404s. svc-JWT *issuance* is live; the *verification* JWKS endpoint isn't wired. Pre-existing gap, logged (bead) — NOT a facade concern, NOT a deploy failure.

**Remaining (operator):** the 30-min stability watch on the Railway dashboard (I can't see it; endpoints are responding correctly). Dashboard CUTOVER (consumer flipping `IDENTITY_RESOLVE_*` live) is still separately gated on #11 backfill — the facade ships `reachable:"unknown"` until then.

## UPDATE 2026-06-02 — Reconciled (Layer 2 → GREEN)

Operator chose "reconcile + re-verify." Done:
- Merged `origin/main` (`#31` world_managers) into the sprint-3 branch (`bafacac`). ONE conflict resolved: `packages/protocol/src/api/index.ts` barrel — unioned the facade's `IdentityResolve*` block + `#31`'s `ManagedWorld` block.
- `#31` extended `SpinePort` with `getManagedWorlds`; added the `[]`-stub to the three branch-side mocks (identity-resolve route + goal-validation, discord-link).
- **Re-gate:** Layer 1 + Layer 2 GREEN — full suite **562 pass / 0 fail**, typecheck clean on touched files, **`#28` (parent→main) = MERGEABLE**. Branch now carries facade + `0007` world_managers.

**Layer 3 (operator gate) is what remains.** The prod flip below is yours — I hold (no prod creds; no-latitude on prod auth deploy).

### ⚠️ Expanded migration gap (prod is lagged)
Prod (`identity.0xhoneyjar.xyz`) serves only the HS256 spine — its deploy predates W2.5 sprint-2. So prod's DB is likely behind by **0003–0007** (cell_api_keys · operator_grants · svc_jwt_issuance · svc_jwt_denylist · world_managers), not just 0007. **Run `migrate:status` against prod first** to see the real gap; `migrate up` applies them in order (all additive). This deploy un-lags the entire ES256 svc-JWT stack + world_managers + the facade in one shot — treat it as a major prod cutover, not a hotfix.

### Operator prod-flip sequence (Layer 3 GO → Flip)
1. Merge `#28` → `main` (carries the whole W2.5 chain + facade to main).
2. `migrate:status` against prod `DATABASE_URL` → `migrate up` (applies the 0003–0007 gap). Keep the `.down.sql`s for rollback.
3. Railway deploys `main` (dashboard auto-deploy or `railway up`).
4. Smoke: `POST /v1/identity/resolve` + bearer → 200; no token → 401; ES256 `/.well-known/jwks.json` stops 404-ing.
5. Watch 30 min. Revert on red (`git revert` #28 merge + `migrate down` + Railway redeploy prior).

## Act 1 — Coordinate (read the substrate)

GATE: **NO-GO.** Reality discovery reframed the scope; pause at the seam.

**Telemetry (verified, not claimed):**
- `#33` `w2.5-identity-resolve-facade` → parent `w2.5-sprint-3-auth-sdk-source-distributed`: **MERGED** (`ed2478d`). Facade integrated onto the sprint-3 branch. Reversible (revert the merge commit).
- `#28` `w2.5-sprint-3` → `main`: **CONFLICTING / DIRTY**. The path to prod is blocked.
- **main diverged.** merge-base = `37896b9` (2026-05-26, #26 sprint-2). main HEAD = `17a023f feat(spine): C-2 world_managers (#31)` — adds migration `0007_world_managers` + code. The sprint-3 branch (migrations 0001–0006) never integrated `#31`.
- **Conflict scope = ONE file:** `packages/protocol/src/api/index.ts` (both `#31` and the facade appended re-export blocks to the protocol barrel — `git merge-tree`). `src/api/index.ts`, `packages/engine/src/index.ts`, `packages/ports/src/index.ts` AUTO-MERGE clean.
- **Deploy mechanism:** Railway dashboard-managed; `start: bun src/api/index.ts` does NOT auto-migrate; `migrate up` is separate.
- **Migration correction:** `0007` is **already on main** (via `#31`), NOT introduced by this chain. Earlier claim ("the chain adds 0007") was FALSE — corrected against the substrate (KRANZ: never flip on a claim).

**Why NO-GO:** "deploy 33" is not a clean merge-to-main. The sprint-3 branch is behind main; `#28` carries an unresolved conflict; and prod's migration state vs main's `0007` is unverified. Pushing past this gate would flip on a divergence we have not reconciled.

## Act 2 — Mirror

N/A — single-repo code deploy, no substrate (CDN/bucket) to duplicate. The only "substrate move" is the prod DB migration state, which is **main's** (`0007`), to be verified via `migrate:status` against prod at flip time.

## Act 3 — Verify (three-layer gate)

- **Layer 1 — smoke:** GREEN. Full suite 550 pass / 0 fail; typecheck clean on touched files; AC-13 (auth byte-unchanged) ✓; AC-14 (no-embed) ✓; OQ-3 `.auth()` gate ✓ (401 without token).
- **Layer 2 — parity:** **RED.** `#28` CONFLICTING; sprint-3 branch ≠ main (#31 not integrated); prod migration state unverified.
- **Layer 3 — operator gate:** **NOT REACHED.** Cannot present GO with Layer 2 red.

## Act 4 — Flip (held)

- **Step 1 (done, reversible):** `#33` → parent. ✓
- **Step 2 (BLOCKED):** resolve `#28` conflict → re-verify → `#28` → main → `migrate:status`/`migrate up` on prod (if `0007` not applied) → Railway deploy → 30-min watch → revert on red.

## Required before re-gate (the amendment)

1. **Reconcile the branch with main:** merge `origin/main` (#31 world_managers) into the sprint-3 branch; resolve the ONE barrel conflict in `packages/protocol/src/api/index.ts` (union both export blocks — facade's `IdentityResolve*` + #31's world_managers exports). Trivial.
2. **Re-run the full suite** with #31 integrated (world_managers + facade coexisting).
3. **Verify prod DB migration state:** `migrate:status` against prod `DATABASE_URL` — confirm whether `0007` is applied (main has it; prod is lagged). Run `migrate up` if pending.
4. **Then** re-open Layer 2/3 gates: `#28` mergeable, suite green, prod migration current → operator GO → flip.

## Rollback posture

- Facade is OQ-3 `.auth()`-gated — even if it reached prod, it's not openly exposed.
- `#33`→parent merge: revert `ed2478d`.
- Prod flip (not taken): `git revert` the `#28` merge + `migrate down` if applicable + Railway redeploys prior.

## Act 5 — Distill

Lesson for the construct + the operator: **Coordinate fully (read main + prod state) BEFORE the first flip.** I merged `#33`→parent before reading main's divergence; the merge was correct + reversible, but the divergence should have been read in Act 1. The sprint-3 branch built the facade on a 2026-05-26 base while main advanced (#31); long-lived feature branches drift from main and surface as conflicts at deploy. Amend: reconcile early, deploy from a main-current branch.
